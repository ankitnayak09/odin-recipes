		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			An omelette or omelet is a dish made from beaten eggs fried with
			butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette
			to be folded around fillings such as cheese, chives, vegetables,
			mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), or some combination of the
			above. To obtain a fluffy texture, whole eggs or sometimes egg
			whites only are beaten with a small amount of milk or cream, or even
			water, the idea being to have "bubbles" of water vapor trapped
			within the rapidly cooked egg. Some home cooks add baking powder to
			produce a fluffier omelette; however, this ingredient is sometimes
			viewed unfavourably by traditionalists.
