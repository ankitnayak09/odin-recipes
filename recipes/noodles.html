<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Noodles are a staple food in many cultures made from unleavened dough which
	is stretched, extruded, or rolled flat and cut into one of a variety of
	shapes. While long, thin strips may be the most common, many varieties of
	noodles are cut into waves, helices, tubes, strings, or shells, or folded
	over, or cut into other shapes. Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water,
	sometimes with cooking oil or salt added. They are often pan-fried or
	deep-fried. Noodles are often served with an accompanying sauce or in a
	soup. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored
	for future use.
